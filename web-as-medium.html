	<h3>Artificial Intelligence: Heading Towards &quotCan Implies Ought&quot?</h3>
	</center>
	<p>If we conceptualize a medium as a means of communication, then the web is the most important medium ever created.  Nothing before has ever had the ability to connect with or influence so many aspects of billions of people.  The internet has become the main way that most people receive their external information and content, where most people get in touch with the world outside of their house.  There is almost nothing that can’t be learned by accessing the web, almost nothing that can’t be seen, bought, or sold.  A person can order food through the web, talk with someone across the world in an instant for no cost, etc.  At this point, the question isn’t what the web can do, but what it can’t do for the right consumer.</p>

	<p>There have been many new introductions to what would constitute media in human history.  Arguably, the printing press and the resulting flood of books and printed material was responsible for a huge spread of ideas and information.  The printing press instituted a major shift in access to information, and more and more people were given access to ideas that before the press were available only to those rich enough or lucky enough to have access to the hand-reproduced copies of old books and tracts.  <i>The Bible</i>, for instance, became something that a commoner could own, and not just the local church or estate.  Ideas and information spread across the known world at a rate unseen before.</p>

	<p>The web, the internet, I would argue, has done even more to make information and media available to the world.  At this point, a person in Estonia can type a few characters into a computer and access pictures of Denali and all of the information they could ever ask for about the mountain.  Within a few minutes they could learn more with greater ease than was available even thirty years ago.  A few seconds worth of work can give someone access to just about <i>anything</i>.  Of course, this can have its drawbacks, as our global political culture has seen fanatical recruitment reach people anywhere, and we have seen violence pop up in the most random of places.  People in Florida radicalized by Syrian militants have wreaked great harm and threatened the safety of nations.  This is goes to show just how fundamental the influence of the web has been for our world.  The limitlessness of what is possible brings both benefits and costs, but what is undeniable is how this medium has transformed the world.</p>

	<p>At this point, we are reliable on the web to an extent that it is a lifeline.  Human society would collapse without it.  Our entire infrastructure depends on the web.  Our ability to move cargo, goods, and other necessities would fall about without its assistance.  The web is as vital to us as the farms that grow the food we eat, the houses we live in, and the states that exist to protect our rights.  It is the most important medium that has ever existed.</p>
