	<h3>Look at me and my awesome kid!!!</h3>
	<p>My name is Michael Ducey. I was born and raised in Omaha, and spent most of my life here. I left for graduate school about ten years ago, and lived in several places in the US: Lubbock, Cincinnati, and Willimantic, CT. I was trying to be a professional philosopher, and in some ways, I'm still trying. I'm working on my dissertation, which is about the interpretation of literature. I also do love to talk philosophy, but I try to warn people ahead of time so they are properly informed and can make an easy excuse to leave the conversation. For a variety of reasons, I have decided not to pursue an academic career in philosophy, or at least for the present time. My family moved back to Omaha last year, and  I was lucky enough to have some time being a stay-at-home dad to my toddler.</p>

	<p>I recently began my time at the Omaha Code School. I see a lot of commonalities between coding and symbolic logic, and having spent time teaching and tutoring logic to students, I spent some time looking into some basic coding. Some kind of bug bit me, and I was hooked into the endless possibilities that can come from writing code.  It's really satisfying to watch what happens when just a few lines of text, ordered properly, are executed.</p>

	<p>In my spare time, I spend too much time on the internet. I suppose I like to play board games of many kinds, but with a young child, I feel like I haven't played them in forever. I have really come to enjoy Omaha in a new way since moving back, and my wife and I have engrossed ourselves in learning Omaha history. I drink too much coffee and not enough beer.</p>
